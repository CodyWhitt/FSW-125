# Using the app
    the app is just a simple display of hard coded values in a data file.
    upon opening it immediately displays the list of objects.
    at the top of the page you have the ability to filter the list of games by name
    instructed to demonstrate the get one ability so this works very simply by taking a key, copy and pasting into the item key field. 
    simply click edit or delete and functions work as you would expect. 
# improvements i would like
    I would like to display only the name of the games in a list and use the get one method to 'open' the game and see the contents with said method. 
    I would also like to see the empty fields get throw an error instead of passing empty values.
